## Coding Style
1. Write efficient and simple code
2. Have a preference for OOP programming
3. Document as you go
4. Practice modular coding practices. If a file has over a 100 lines of code (not including documentation), create a helper service, utility, or component and refactor it.

## Documentation
1. All classes should have multi-line doc strings that show a description, attributes, and public functions
2. All functions should have a multi-line doc string that show a description, parameters, returns, and example usage.
3. Inline comments should be beside their respective lines
4. For python, use triple qoutes for the doc strings

## Testing
1. For each class (python) create a pytest that performs unit testing
